# Amazon Product Analysis
Amazon data analysis project featuring search term and returns insights with reports and an interactive Excel dashboard.
This project includes two detailed reports—Search Term Analysis and Returns Analysis—along with an interactive Excel dashboard.

The Search Term Analysis examines Amazon Sponsored Products data to identify the top and bottom 5 keywords based on ACoS, ROAS, and Conversion Rate. It highlights high-impression but low-conversion terms and provides actionable recommendations for keyword bidding and campaign strategy improvements.

The Returns Analysis focuses on identifying frequently returned ASINs, uncovering common return reasons, and suggesting enhancements to product listings and presentation.

The accompanying Excel dashboard leverages pivot tables and conditional formatting to present key insights in a clear and actionable format.
